I am an Electrical Engineering Major at CSUF and I am currently in senior standing, planning to graduate by the end of 2026 to early 2027. I plan on applying for internships in my field very soon, so I can start my career post graduation. I currently work at Trader Joe's and have been for the past 8 years, ever since I graduated high school. I transferred to CSUF from Santa Monica College (SMC) and have been very pleased with my decision to attend this university.

## Favorite Labs from CPSC 120:
* Lab 4:

    For lab 4, I worked with Ethan. We both took turns writing our code for each part, and honestly, everything went really smooth. For part 1, we learned how to write code that lets us convert units into others of equivalent size. We were able to take multiple units and convert them. For part 2, we used what we learn to play a HiLo game. This was a nice spin on our normal labs, we were able to create a game that would guess a number within a certain range and tell us if we were too high, too low, or right on the money. This lab helped us to be able to write code that printed out messages based on each game. I really enjoyed doing this lab a lot, this lab went the smoothest due to the fact that we had very little errors in all of our tests. This lab helped me get a better grasp of if, else if, and else statements in my code.

* Lab 2:

    For lab 2, I worked with Joshua and we collaborated on the only part in this lab. For this lab, we had write code that used strings to be able to print out a full message. This was one of our first labs, but built upon lab 1 where we had to print "Hello World!" From here, we had to create prompts for each code so that we can input many types of nouns, verbs, and adjectives in our to make one big phrase. Overall, the lab was not very difficult, but it did build upon how we can properly format and lint our work in order to really test if our code is viable or not. I really enjoyed this lab, because it foreshadowed a lot of the work we would have to do throughout the semester; it gave some insight on what proper testing would come to look like in this lab section.

* Lab 6:

    For lab 6, I worked with Andrew. I really enjoyed working on the part-2 section of this lab, because we were essentially playing blackjack! In this lab, we strayed from hard coding in order for our project to work. Since everything is situational in this lab, we had multiple variables at stake. We had to create command arguments that allowed us to play blackjack and continue to until we won, lost, or even drew with the dealer. This lab built upon a lot of else if statements due to the fact that each card was different. We had to write multiple variables for each number and also for each type of card, whether it was a numbered card or a face card. I really enjoyed this lab, because it helped me to see how we can properly write in multiples arguments in our code and command it to print out the correct output.
